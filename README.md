## Goals
The primary goals of this project are the following:
1. Practice with the development of a larger project over the course of a semester
2. To gain experience working as a part of a small team
3. To implement a variety of game-related algorithms 
4. To implement data structures for a game 
5. To have fun making a game

## Mission Statement
Gain the valuable experience of working with a team to build something with each individual’s coding skills being improved upon 
and create something to be proud of but not something totally perfect.

### Discord
We will use the discord server to further discuss any questions that come up while we are outside of our meeting times. Also use the server to point out 
any problems that come up while you are working and if you need to show us some code then take a snippet of it and send it to the chat so we can take a better look at it.

### Meeting Times
Mondays ~6:00p.m.
Saturdays ~1:00p.m.
We will run meetings by discussing where we are in the project and what 
we need to be done by what time. From there we will talk about who needs to do what by that time.

## Repository Overview
